### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

This is the first page that I have designed using HTML and CSS. Yes , It has flaws but I have just started and I'm happy that I came up with the solution myself. In future projects that I build I will try to minimize the issues and would also make an effort to design flawless responsive websites.
